I remember sitting in front of my computer, writing every line of code on Notepad, armed with the skills I had learned in class. It was both exhilarating and daunting, but I was determined to bring my vision to life. Here are a few features and functionalities that I implemented:

1. 𝗗𝗿𝗼𝗽 𝗗𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘂 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗛𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗘𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀 : A navigation tool that allowed users to seamlessly browse through all pages.
2. 𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗦𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘄 & 𝗩𝗶𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿 𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗻𝘁 : Engaging elements that showcased our school’s activities while tracking our audience.
3. 𝗧𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 `<𝗧𝗔𝗕𝗟𝗘>` 𝗧𝗮𝗴𝘀 : Keeping it simple and structured with basic HTML!
4. 𝗦𝗰𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗹 𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲𝘀 𝘃𝗶𝗮 𝗚𝗼𝗼𝗴𝗹𝗲 𝗠𝗮𝗽𝘀 𝟯𝗗 𝗩𝗶𝗲𝘄 : An innovative method to gather visuals that represented our school.
5. 𝗚𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗟𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝗯𝗼𝘅 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 : Creating a visually appealing experience for visitors to explore photos.

Of course, it wasn’t all smooth sailing! I faced a couple of challenges along the way:

- 𝗟𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗪𝗲𝗯 𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻 : I designed the site for a 15.6-inch screen, which meant it wasn’t mobile-friendly.
- 𝗡𝗼 𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 : My skills at the time were focused solely on HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, leaving me with static pages.

Ironically, it was on this same day in 2018 that I finalized the project and saved it as a backup! Looking back, that experience ignited my passion for web development and set me on a path of continuous learning and growth.

As I celebrate this milestone, I’m grateful for the journey and excited for what the future holds. To anyone starting their own projects, remember: 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱. 𝗞𝗲𝗲𝗽 𝗽𝘂𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗯𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀!
