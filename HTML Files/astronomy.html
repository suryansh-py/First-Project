<P>Astronomy may be most simply defined as the study of astronomical objects and phenomenon. It is concerned with most domains in Science like physics and Chemistry as well as skills like Navigation. Mathematics is also engraved in the study of astronomy. As such, Astronomy Clubs are a very effective medium to introduce these subjects to students outside of the classroom and maintain an everlasting interest.
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5">O</FONT>ur School also has Astronomical Facilities like Telescope, They have higher magnification and higher Exposure Levels which enables Students to seek out other Planets.
Every Year we get a chance to seek other Planets like Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. There are Total of 6 Telescpes with Celestron magnification.

<h3> Importance of astronomy </h3>
<OL>
<Li><B>Increases a sense of excitement and wonder amongst the students.</B></Li>
<p>Astronomy Clubs are a great way to keep the children engaged with activities different from the daily routine. Club activities make up for their hobby time away from the daily schedules of subject classes in schools. Students enjoy this time to learn and explore things. In addition, having dedicated astronomy clubs in schools gives them the opportunity to know more about the celestial objects. Because of the involvement of hands-on activities and observation sessions, astronomy clubs are a hit amongst the students.</P>
<Li><B>Astronomy Clubs give them a scientific structure for the study of astronomy.</B></Li>
<p>While astronomy enjoys a lot of attention for masses, for a student it is also important to give it a serious direction and structure. An interest in Astronomy requires proper guidance so that the interest doesn't fade away due to lack of opportunities. Astronomy Clubs in schools are the building blocks for preserving that passion and interest amongst students. Providing proper resources and information to the curious minds is the stepping stone in the making of future astronomers and scientists.</p>
<Li><B>Gives them a peer group to share their passion and learning.</B></Li>
<p>Astronomy Clubs are a chance to connect with other enthusiasts and enjoy stargazing together. There is so much happening in the field of astronomical and cosmological research. The knowledge and information in this field are so vast that there is no dearth of how much more you can learn. Astronomy Clubs are a great way to connect with peers and hear their stories of observation and interest areas. Whether it is Sun, Moon, Solar System, or far away galaxies, or extraterrestrial, there is so much to know and explore.</p>
<li><B>Astronomy Clubs are a great platform to interact with professionals and amateurs.</B></li>
<p>Even though the professionals working in the field of astronomy have a hectic work schedule, most of them spend a considerable time outreaching to young enthusiastic astronomers. Astronomy Clubs can invite such professionals to interact with the club members. These allow students to interact with the outside world, get in tune with the current research areas and most up to date findings, and also promotes carries in Science and Astronomy.</p>
<li><B>Study of astronomy polishes many other important skills.</B></li>
<p>Lastly, Astronomy Clubs are a useful extra-curricular activity in schools not just to promote the interest in astronomy but also to polish other skills. It's a great STEM activity, as though the activities, observations, and concepts of the astronomical phenomenon, students get to practice the tools of data analysis and scientific reasoning.</p>
